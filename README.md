## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic **Connect Four** game, developed using **Blazor WebAssembly** and **.NET 8**.

The core game logic and idea were originally adapted from the official [Microsoft Learn training module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/dotnet-connect-four/), which provides an educational walkthrough for building a simple Connect Four game in .NET.

The goal of the game is to allow two players to take turns placing colored discs into a vertical grid, with the objective of being the first to align four of their discs either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project serves both as a practical .NET learning exercise and a fully functional browser game.

You can play the game live in your browser: [link](https://ruslan-vladyslav.github.io/ConnectFour-Blazor/)
