        <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-3">🎯 Objective</h4>
        <p>
            The goal of Connect Four is simple: be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line
            of four of your own discs. The game is played on a vertical grid of 7 columns and 6 rows.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">🕹️ How to Play</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>On your turn, choose a column to drop your disc into.</li>
            <li>The disc will fall to the lowest available space within that column.</li>
            <li>Players alternate turns until one player connects four, or the board is full (resulting in a draw).</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">🏆 Winning the Game</h4>
        <p>
            A player wins by connecting four discs of their color in a row — this can be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Horizontally</strong> (left to right)</li>
            <li><strong>Vertically</strong> (top to bottom)</li>
            <li><strong>Diagonally</strong> (in either direction)</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">🤖 AI Mode</h4>
        <p>
            In single-player mode, you’ll be facing an AI opponent. The AI will make decisions based on a simple strategy —
            but don’t underestimate it!
        </p>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">👥 Players</h4>
        <p>
            The game is played between two players: <strong>Player 1</strong> and <strong>Player 2</strong>.
            Players take turns dropping their discs into any of the columns.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">💡 Tips & Strategies</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Try to control the center column — it gives more chances to connect in all directions.</li>
            <li>Watch your opponent closely and block their attempts to connect four.</li>
            <li>Plan ahead — setting traps can force your opponent into making a mistake.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h4 class="fw-semibold mt-4 mb-3">🔁 Restarting the Game</h4>
        <p>
            Once a match ends, you can start a new game by clicking the "Restart" button.
            Scores may be tracked depending on the mode.
